"""
clawmetry/entitlements.py — open-core entitlement resolution.

Single source of truth for "what is this install allowed to do". Everything
that gates a runtime or an advanced feature reads :func:`get_entitlement` —
nothing should gate on a hardcoded plan check scattered across routes.

Open-core model
---------------
* **FREE** (this OSS package): the OpenClaw + NVIDIA NemoClaw runtimes +
  NeMo governance + the core observability surface. Always available — no
  key, no network call.
* **PAID** (the closed-source ``clawmetry-pro`` package, fetched only with
  a valid license key or a cloud entitlement — it is *not* shipped in this
  repo): the other agent runtimes (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …), the
  advanced features (custom alerts, multi-node fleet, anomaly detection, …),
  and paid CLI capabilities.
