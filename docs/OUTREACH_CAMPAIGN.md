*Last updated: Feb 18, 2026*

## Goal
Reach 1,000+ OpenClaw users in 30 days through organic community engagement.

---

## Channel Strategy

### 1. OpenClaw Discord (Primary)
- **Action:** Post in #showcase or #plugins channel
- **Content:** "Built an observability dashboard for OpenClaw — tracks costs, tokens, model usage in real-time. One pip install, zero config. Open source."
- **Screenshot:** Dashboard with real data (anonymized)
- **Link:** GitHub repo + PyPI
- **Timing:** Weekday morning US time (high Discord activity)

### 2. Reddit
**Target subreddits:**
- r/LocalLLaMA (~500K members) — "I built a cost monitoring dashboard for AI agents"
- r/ChatGPT / r/artificial — if relevant discussion
- r/selfhosted (~400K) — "Self-hosted AI agent monitoring in a single Python file"
- r/OpenSource — launch post

**Post format:** Show, don't tell. Screenshot + "I was spending $X/day on AI APIs without realizing. Built this to track it."

### 3. X (Twitter)
**Thread format:**
1. Hook: "I was burning $50/day on AI agent API calls. Built a dashboard to fix it."
2. Screenshot of cost tracking
3. Screenshot of budget alerts
4. "One command install, no Docker, no cloud. Just `pip install clawmetry`"
5. Link to GitHub

**Target accounts to engage with:**
- OpenClaw official (@openclaw)
- AI agent builders, Claude Code users
- Self-hosted community accounts
- AI cost optimization discussions

### 4. YouTube
- **Video 1:** "How I Track My AI Agent Spending" (5 min demo)
- **Video 2:** "ClawMetry: Open Source AI Observability" (setup tutorial)
- **Channel:** VedicVoice or new dev channel (TBD with Vivek)

### 5. Hacker News
- "Show HN: ClawMetry — Self-hosted observability for AI agents (single Python file)"
- Best timing: Tuesday/Wednesday 9-11 AM EST
- Keep title factual, not hype-y

### 6. GitHub
- **README:** Compelling, with screenshots and GIFs
- **Topics:** ai-observability, llm-monitoring, openclaw, cost-tracking
- **GitHub Discussions:** Enable and seed with FAQ
- **Issue templates:** Bug report, feature request

## Key Messages

**For developers:**
> "One pip install. Zero config. See exactly what your AI agents cost."

**For self-hosted community:**
> "No cloud, no Docker compose, no Postgres. Just a single Python file that reads your agent's OTLP data."

**For cost-conscious teams:**
> "Budget auto-pause: set a daily limit, and ClawMetry stops your agent before it blows your API budget."
