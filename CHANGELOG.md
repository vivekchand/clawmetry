## [0.12.53] — 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- NameError crash on encryption key prompt (`_input` not defined in `_cmd_connect`)

## [0.12.52] — 2026-03-17

### Improved
- Always show encryption key prompt during onboard and connect (full transparency)
- Existing key shown masked with option to keep or replace

## [0.12.51] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- Prompt for custom encryption key during `clawmetry connect` (press Enter to auto-generate)

---

## [0.12.45] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- `clawmetry connect --key` no longer crashes in non-interactive shells (SSH, CI/CD, Docker)
- Sync daemon retries on 401/503 (cloud cold-start resilience)

---

## [0.12.44] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Sync daemon `_post()` retries once on 401/503 responses (cloud cold-start resilience)
- Prevents sync daemon from permanently skipping sessions when Cloud Run returns transient auth errors

---

## [0.12.43] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- `sync_crons` now sends full schedule object, state (lastRunAtMs, lastDurationMs, nextRunAtMs, lastError, consecutiveFailures), and task description to cloud
- Maps `consecutiveErrors` field (OpenClaw's actual field name) to `consecutiveFailures` for renderer compatibility

---

## [0.10.11] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Dark mode now correctly forced on load — initTheme() was overriding body dark mode with localStorage light default

---

## [0.10.10] — 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Dark mode always on, remove theme toggle (merged via PR #37)

---

## [0.10.9] — 2026-02-28

### Changed
- Dark mode is now the permanent default — removed theme toggle button

---

## [0.10.8] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Auth check runs before boot sequence — login overlay shows immediately if token invalid/missing
- Boot overlay no longer covers the login prompt on stale token
- Overview request storm on boot: removed duplicate loadAll() call, added in-flight guard

---

## [0.10.7] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Port conflict check moved to daemon mode only — foreground mode was false-positive blocking all ports

---

## [0.10.6] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Port conflict: only kill our own stale clawmetry process, not arbitrary apps on the same port
- Clear error message if another app is already using the port

---

## [0.10.5] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Installer now auto-starts daemon immediately after install via full binary path (works with curl|bash)

---

## [0.10.4] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Hide `clawmetry connect` command from help (cloud integration not yet production ready)

---

## [0.10.3] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Architecture diagram boxes broken due to emoji double-width characters — switched to pure ASCII +---+ style

---
