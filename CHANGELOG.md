## [0.10.11] — 2026-02-28

---

---

---

## [0.10.7] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed

---

## [0.10.6] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Port conflict: only kill our own stale clawmetry process, not arbitrary apps on the same port
- Clear error message if another app is already using the port

---

### Added

- **CI matrix** — Linux/macOS/Windows on every PR via GitHub Actions
- **BrowserStack CI** — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on merge to main

### Fixed
- Gateway token not found on restart (`openclaw.json` missing from config search path)
- New channels (iMessage etc.) missing from `KNOWN_CHANNELS` list

- Unconfigured channels (Signal/WhatsApp) showing in Flow when not in config
- `grep`/`tail`/`pgrep` subprocess calls replaced with pure Python (Windows compatibility)
- `/tmp/openclaw` hardcoded log paths replaced with `_get_log_dirs()` cross-platform helper
- Windows UTF-8 crash — 🦞 emoji in BANNER failed on cp1252 encoding
- `setup.py` reading `dashboard.py` without `encoding="utf-8"` (Windows pip install failure)

### Changed
- Channel nodes in Flow now hide automatically if not configured in `openclaw.json`
