## [Unreleased]

### Local store: multi-agent foundation + naming (epic #964)
- **Local DB renamed** `events.duckdb` → `clawmetry.duckdb`. The DB now
  holds events, sessions, memory blobs, heartbeats, system snapshots
  (and soon spans for tracing) — `events.duckdb` was outgrowing its name.
  **Auto-migrates** an existing `events.duckdb` (and its `.wal` sibling)
  on next start. Lossless, no schema change. Skipped if you've set
  `CLAWMETRY_LOCAL_STORE_PATH` to a custom location.
- **Multi-agent schema** (SCHEMA_VERSION 1 → 2). New tables: `sessions`,
  `memory_blobs`, `heartbeats`, `system_snapshots`, `crons`, `subagents`,
  `openclaw_channels`. `agent_type` discriminator added to `events` and
  `daily_aggregates` so OpenClaw / Claude Code / Hermes / Cursor / Codex /
  Aider all coexist in one store. v1 stores auto-upgraded with `ALTER
  TABLE ADD COLUMN agent_type DEFAULT 'openclaw'` — legacy rows preserved.
- **Daemon write-through for sessions / memory / heartbeats**. Each cloud
  sync (`/ingest/sessions`, `/ingest/memory`, `/ingest/heartbeat`) now also
  persists locally before shipping to cloud. Best-effort; local failures
  never block cloud sync.
- **Dashboard reads sessions from local DB** under
  `CLAWMETRY_LOCAL_STORE_READ=1` (opt-in, falls through to gateway/JSONL
  when unset OR store is empty).

### Cloud cold-data relay (epic #964 phases 3b + 4)
- **WebSocket relay client** (`clawmetry/relay.py`) — long-lived WS to
  `wss://app.clawmetry.com/api/node/relay`. Listens for `{type:"query"}`
  frames from the cloud, dispatches via the same `relay_dispatch()` the
  local HTTP API uses, returns chunked responses. Reconnect with
  exponential backoff (2s → 60s cap). Cloud dashboard can now ask the
  user's machine for data older than the 24h hot window without us paying
  for permanent cloud storage.
- **`websocket-client` is now a base install dep** (was previously
  `extras_require["relay"]`). The opt-in caused cloud users to silently
  miss the relay. `pip install clawmetry && clawmetry connect` "just works"
  again. The `[relay]` extra is kept as a no-op for backwards compat with
  old install scripts.
- Cloud-side broker shipped in `clawmetry-cloud#705` + `#711` + `#712`
  (gunicorn + gevent-websocket migration so flask-sock can do WS upgrades
  in production).

### Heartbeat
- **`local_store_size_mb`** + `local_store` health block on every
  heartbeat. Cloud-side rollout playbook will gate phase 2 (cloud
  retention slim) on ≥80% of nodes reporting healthy local stores.

### Brain history
- **Opt-in fast path** under `CLAWMETRY_LOCAL_STORE_READ=1` —
  `/api/brain-history` returns directly from the local DuckDB (tagged
  `_source: "local_store"`) instead of re-parsing JSONL. Falls through to
  the legacy parser when the env var is unset OR the store is empty.

### Tests
- 70+ new tests covering: relay dispatch, chunking, error frames,
  capability drift, brain fast-path, sessions fast-path, schema
  migration v1→v2, ingest_session/memory_blob/heartbeat helpers, daemon
  write-through, the events.duckdb→clawmetry.duckdb rename + WAL move,
  env-override skip, no-clobber when both files exist.

### Local-first foundation (epic #964 phase 1) — first shipped in 0.12.164
- **Local DuckDB event store** at `~/.clawmetry/events.duckdb` — durable record of every telemetry event the daemon parses. Switched from SQLite to DuckDB (decision in clawmetry-cloud meta-PRD): columnar storage makes the dashboard's GROUP BY / time-window analytics 10–100× faster, and unlocks future Parquet export. Adds `duckdb>=0.10` as a dependency.
- **Daemon writes through to local store** at parse time — local is now the source of truth, cloud is a hot cache. Failures in the local path never block cloud sync.
- **Two new diagnostic endpoints** — `/api/local-store/health` and `/api/local-store/events` for verification + test harnesses
- 27 passing tests cover ingest validation, idempotency, batch flush, query filters, restart persistence, ring overflow, and the full sync→store wire-through
- Note: 0.12.164's SQLite `events.db` file is left in place but no longer read; safe to delete after upgrade.

## v0.12.120

### Improved
- **Uninstall purges server-side registration** — `clawmetry uninstall` now calls `/api/unregister` to delete the node_registry entry, preventing stale account re-linking on reinstall (#741)

---

## v0.12.119

### Improved
- **E2E secret key shown during install** — `curl | bash` now displays the encryption key so users can paste it when opening the dashboard (#738)

## v0.12.118

### Agent Observability Suite
- **Real-time event streamer** — Dropbox-style file-size diffing pushes brain events instantly instead of 15s polling (#718)
- **Channel session badges** — Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/Slack/IRC/iMessage badges in Brain tab with filter chips (#725)
- **Channel metadata sync** — session_key, channel, chat_type synced to cloud for multi-channel visibility (#726)
- **Skill badges + file browser** — skill usage badges on brain events + IDE-like skill file browser (#728)
- **Flow tab architecture upgrade** — provider stack with fallback slots, skills column, Brain→Skills path (#729)
- **LLM Context Inspector** — token breakdown bars, system prompt viewer, compaction history (#730)
- **Agent Runtime Timeline** — per-turn drill-down with tool/LLM/user phase bars (#731)
- **ACP sub-agent visibility** — nested sub-agent events in runtime timeline (#732)
- **E2E key from URL fragment** — encryption key passed via `#hash`, never touches the server (#734)

### Fixed
- Heartbeat interval NaN when `interval_seconds` is missing (#717)

### Docs
- Comprehensive agent observability guide with architecture diagrams (OBSERVABILITY.md) (#733)

### Added (prior unreleased)
- **Cloud autonomy trending** (pairs with clawmetry-cloud#360). The sync daemon now computes a daily autonomy aggregate (median nudge gap, autonomy ratio, 7-day trend slope) locally from session transcripts and pushes only the aggregate — not raw content — to `ingest.clawmetry.com/ingest/autonomy`. Raw memory stays E2E-encrypted; cloud displays the trend on `app.clawmetry.com/fleet`. Throttled to one push per UTC day. Respects `cloud_autonomy_sync: false` opt-out.

### Fixed
- **Skills tab sort order** — dead skills were sorting to the *bottom* of the list instead of the top (`order['dead']` is 0, and `0 || 9` evaluates to 9, so "dead" slipped to the end). Uses `in` membership check now so "Safe to remove" rows surface where they should.

### Fixed
- **`pip install clawmetry` now actually works end-to-end.** Since the routes/ helpers/ templates/ extractions (0.12.90-series), the published wheels silently omitted the non-Python asset directories — installed users' dashboards 404'd on `/static/js/app.js` and failed at import because `from routes.sessions import bp_sessions` had no target. `static/` and `templates/` now ship under the `clawmetry/` package; `routes/` and `helpers/` are declared top-level packages. A new `wheel-install` CI job verifies every release by installing the wheel in a fresh venv and requesting `/static/js/app.js`.
- **Structural move**: `static/*` → `clawmetry/static/*`, `templates/*` → `clawmetry/templates/*`. `app = Flask(...)` now passes `static_folder` / `template_folder` pointed at the package-relative paths. URL surface (`/static/...`) unchanged; users see no behavioural difference.
- **Boot overlay no longer hangs forever on slow setups.** `waitress threads=8` → `32`, and `bootDashboard()` races an 8s hard timeout so the overlay always dismisses even when one bootstrap endpoint stalls.
- **Subagent modal now shows logs for GC'd / failed spawns.** Reconstructs child output from the parent session's `Internal task completion event` messages; splits into **Overview** + **Brain Events** tabs; skips auto-refresh for immutable entries; Active Tasks panel tightened from 24h window to 10 minutes.
- **Subprocess + WebSocket hang-proofing**: `df`, `free`, `uptime`, `pgrep` get `timeout=2`; `_gw_ws_rpc` uses `ws.settimeout(5)` so a stalled gateway can't pin the request thread.
- **`/api/subagents` cache-mutation bug** — the endpoint was mutating the shared `_sessions_cache["data"]` list, causing duplicate entries to accumulate on every call. Now copies before mutating.

### Added
- **Service status indicators** — fleet node cards now display color-coded status dots for Gateway, Channels, Sync, and Resources (closes #254)
- New `/api/service-status` endpoint returns compact `{gateway, channels, sync, resources}` dict suitable for sync-daemon heartbeat payloads
- `/api/system-health` now includes `service_status` field in the same format, enabling local-node fleet self-registration

### How it works
- Sync daemons include `service_status` in their `POST /api/nodes/<id>/metrics` push
- Fleet overview renders a mini status bar under each node card: 🟢 GW · 🟢 telegram · 🟢 sync · 🟡 res
- Color legend: green = healthy, yellow = degraded, red = down, gray = unknown
